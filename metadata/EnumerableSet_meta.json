Sets have the following properties: - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time (O(1)). - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet; } ``` As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported. [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableSet. ====","kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol":"EnumerableSet"},"evmVersion":"shanghai","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol":{"keccak256":"0x9f4357008a8f7d8c8bf5d48902e789637538d8c016be5766610901b4bba81514","license":"MIT","urls":["bzz-raw://20bf19b2b851f58a4c24543de80ae70b3e08621f9230eb335dc75e2d4f43f5df","dweb:/ipfs/QmSYuH1AhvJkPK8hNvoPqtExBcgTB42pPRHgTHkS5c5zYW"]}},"version":1}
